year = 3000
year += 1

# Greater Than

a > b

# Less Than
# Use the less than operator to determine whether or not the variable "b" is less than the variable "a"

b < a

# Greater Than Or Equal To 
# Use the greater than or equal to operator to determine whether or not the variable "a" is greater than or equal to the variable "b"

a >= b

# Less Than Or Equal To
# Use the less than or equal to operator to determine whether or not the variable "b" is less than or equal to the variable "a".

b <= a
